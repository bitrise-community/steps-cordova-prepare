title: Cordova Prepare
summary: Runs Cordova Prepare for your project
description: |-
  Prepares your Cordova project. 
  
  The Step prepares your Cordova project by calling `cordova prepare` and copying files into platform(s), making the project ready to be built.

  ### Configuring the Step
  
  1. Make sure the selected platform (iOS, Android, or both) matches your project in the **Platform to use in cordova-cli commands** Step input.
  2. The **Cordova version** input can be used to install a specific version of Cordova. By default the pre-installed version will be used which can differ from stack to stack. Check the current stack images [here](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports).
  3. For the **Working directory** input, make sure you have your `config.xml` file at the root of your repository, or in case it's located elsewhere, make sure this input points to that directory.
  4. Caching can be enabled for `node_modules` provided you have the [Cache Pull](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/cache-pull) and [Cache Push](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/cache-push) Steps set up.  

  ### Troubleshooting
  
  Make sure your platforms are added to your `config.xml` & `package.json` before running `cordova prepare` as that is a prerequisite of running this command.
